# XICombinedMaps

This map pack combines several packs together to create a singular pack with all maps on FFXI edited in some form.

The order of layering the packs goes: Original maps labeled -> Remapster -> Moops Remapster Labeled

Expect this repo to be a bit out dated as each map creators updates their own packs, I will try my best to get this updated when that happens.

I DID NOT CREATE THESE MAPS. PLEASE GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL CREATORS.
